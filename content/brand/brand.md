# Brand

## In one paragraph

Lazurio Example Organization finds online mechanisms that demonstrably earn
money, adapts them legally under its own brand, tests them small and scales
only what has evidence. The brand therefore looks like a **calm instrument
panel**: graphite surfaces that stay out of the way, one **signal blue** for
the action that moves work forward, and a warm **lumen** light that marks the
one place to look right now. Nothing glows for decoration. If something is
lit, it carries information.

## Principles

1. **Evidence first.** Numbers, sources and dates are visible, aligned and
   easy to compare. A claim without evidence is shown as a hypothesis.
2. **One action per view.** Each screen or slide has at most one primary
   action in signal blue. Everything else is secondary.
3. **Light means attention.** Lumen marks focus, a highlight or what changed.
   It never fills large areas and never carries text on its own.
4. **Quiet by default.** Generous spacing, few borders, no gradients, no
   drop shadows beyond the two elevation levels.
5. **Status is a word, not only a colour.** Every coloured status also says
   what it is ("Hypothesis", "Verified signal").

## Wordmark

The wordmark is set in the sans typeface, weight 650, followed by the
**signal dot**: a circle a quarter of the cap height wide, in `accent` on light
and `highlight` on dark backgrounds.

- Short form: **Example** with the signal dot. Use it where the full name does
  not fit (tabs, favicons, slide footers).
- Keep clear space of at least the cap height on every side.
- Never stretch, outline, rotate or recolour the wordmark, and never put it on
  a busy image.

There are no logo files in this repository yet; the viewer draws the wordmark
in CSS. When files exist, they go to `content/brand/logo/` with a sibling
Markdown file naming their source.

## Imagery

- Prefer real product screenshots, charts and diagrams over stock photos.
- Charts use the status roles for status and the accent for the one series that
  matters; every other series is `text-subtle`.
- No people-stock, no money imagery (coins, banknotes, rockets), no
  "get rich" visual metaphors.

## Visual do and don't

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| One primary button per view | Two blue buttons side by side |
| Lumen underline on what changed since the last review | Lumen as a background of a whole card |
| A table with aligned figures and the date of verification | A big hero number without its source |
| Status badges with a word | A red or green dot without a label |
| Plain white or graphite surfaces | Gradients, glassmorphism, glow effects |
