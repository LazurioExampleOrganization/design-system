# Screen: Stop or scale decision

The end of an experiment: a decision is prepared as a draft and published.

## What to notice

- The decision is a **Draft** until the owner publishes it.
- The review summary says exactly what publishing does: the experiment stops,
  the budget is released, and the summary goes to four named people.
- The **confirm dialog** is a question ("Publish the stop decision?"), lists
  the consequences with numbers and says that it can't be undone. Its primary
  button is **Publish**.
- After publishing, a success toast states what happened, with no fake undo.
